pub use native::*;

// For use in Rust
//
// - Collect into a module to improve code organization, but immediately re-export.
//
// - Each function simply calls its inline analogue with the sole objective of not
//   inlining code when not necessary. The inline functions are still available to
//   the crate for more specialized use.
mod native {}

// For use in other languages, e.g. C/C++/Python
//
// - Re-export at crate::ffi, since symbols need to be unmangled anyway and the
//   namespace will not be preserved.
//
// - Here too each function calls its inline analogue, but the objective is to
//   switch from generic to concrete argument types so that the functions can
//   be compiled into a C dynamic library. To do so, we need to double their
//   number (one function for real arguments, another for complex arguments).
pub(crate) mod ffi {}

// For internal use only
//
// - Here we define the building blocks for the other functions. This module
//   serves two purposes: to hold inlined functions and to provide a single
//   source of truth for the actual mathematical expressions
pub(crate) mod inlines {}
